# Cursor Project Rules – Football Transfer Simulator

## General Principles
- Keep architecture modular and clean.
- Avoid overengineering.
- Prefer simple, readable solutions over complex abstractions.
- Do not introduce new frameworks unless explicitly requested.
- Maintain clear separation of concerns between scraper, strategy engine, backend, and AI layer.

## Scope Constraints
- This is a rule-based transfer simulator, not a real football simulation engine.
- Do not implement match simulation, reinforcement learning, or optimization engines.
- Do not add agent frameworks (e.g., LangGraph) unless explicitly requested.
- Historical data is used as a starting state only.

## Code Structure Rules
- Each module should have a single responsibility.
- Avoid files longer than ~300 lines.
- Use type hints where appropriate.
- Write clean docstrings for public functions.
- Avoid deeply nested logic.

## Scraper Rules
- Use lightweight scraping (requests + BeautifulSoup preferred).
- Implement basic anti-scraping handling (headers, delays).
- Structure scraped data into clearly defined schemas.
- Handle missing fields gracefully.

## Strategy Engine Rules
- Strategy logic must be deterministic and rule-based.
- Budget constraints must always be enforced.
- State updates must be explicit and traceable.
- Avoid hidden side effects.

## AI Integration Rules
- AI should consume structured data only.
- Prompts should be deterministic and reproducible.
- Do not allow AI to control core business logic.
- AI is used for explanation, not decision-making.

## API & Backend Rules
- Use FastAPI unless otherwise specified.
- Keep endpoints minimal and clearly documented.
- Validate inputs using Pydantic models.
- Keep business logic separate from route definitions.

## Frontend Rules
- Keep UI clean and simple.
- Prioritize clarity over styling complexity.
- Avoid heavy frontend frameworks unless explicitly decided.

## Documentation Rules
- Each major design decision should be explainable.
- Include reasoning for library choices.
- Document known limitations and trade-offs.
